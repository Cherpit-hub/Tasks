For this practical task, Selenium WebDriver and any preferred by you unit test framework (NUnit, MSTest or xUnit) should be used. 
Basic WebDriver features as browser interactions, capabilities and features browser specifics, explicit and implicit waits should be used. 
Read website URL from config file as a property. Enlarge the window. Use basic commands that can be executed on an element (at least click, sendKeys, clear).

• ID locator
• Name locator
• ClassName locator
• TagName locator
• LinkText locator
• PartialLinkText locator
• CSS locator (if possible, use pseudo-classes)
• XPath locator (Relative path)
• XPath locator with any operator
• XPath locator with axes
